# Practical identifiability analysis for PDE models of cell invasion

MATLAB code for performing practical identifiability analysis. This is supplement to Liu, Suh, Maini, Cohen & Baker 2023 "Parameter identifiability and model selection for partial differential equation models of cell invasion".

If you are not the author, you should switch to the "public" branch, as this branch is mostly work-in-progress with things you are unlikely to be interested in.
